# glm-xmpp

Started as an xmpp bot to work with the nanogpt.com api (see 
[first commit](https://github.com/jjj333-p/glm-xmpp/tree/7d395c3bd58ddfb650a7299e2f6f0926abd65063),
however it is broken), to test working with Mellium. Now its 
simply a testing suite for [Oasis SDK](https://github.com/jjj333-p/oasis-sdk).
